# [2005-2007 Dataset](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/cp.html)  

HUD has created a set of Excel files for each state, plus DC and Puerto Rico. These files are appropriate for planners and local practitioners interested only in their geographic area. More extensive guidance for using these files is provided here: [CHAS Users Guide](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/cp/CHAS/2007Data/CHAS%20basic%20users%20guide.doc)

Because of the large amount of data in each table and the large number of jurisdictions, providing nationwide data in only one file per table is beyond the capacity of Excel, except at the state level. For example, if Table 1—with 249 rows of data per jurisdiction—were provided for all 1,882 counties in one file, that file would have 468,618 rows. Below are 52 zip files—one for each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico—each of which contains data for that state only, in Excel. The Excel files are named as follows: CA\_Table1\_050, where “CA” indicates the state, “Table1” is the table, and “050” is the geographic summary level. For 19 states in which MCDs are the primary governmental or administrative divisions of a county, there are 36 Excel files in each zip file—18 at the summary level 050 and 18 at the summary level 060. All other zip files contain 18 Excel files.
