"Note"
"This file is the data dictionary for the 2005-2007 CHAS tabulation raw data files. The file contains three tabs. This tab is a traditional data dictionary in that it explains the columns in the data files. The second tab explains the variable 'order', which is the key to the variable 'estimate'. The third tab further explains the variables used to create the CHAS data."
